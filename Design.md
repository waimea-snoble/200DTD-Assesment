## Relevant Implications

### IMPLICATION NAME HERE

The usability implications of a website relates to how easy it is for the end-user to use the website, without the need for help or guidance.

I will need to design my system to be as easy as possible to use because some of the parents of the gymnasts may not be as experienced in using technology as others. I will need to make sure my website can be used everyone no matter what experience they have.

When I am designing my websites UI I will refer to Nielson's heuristics, this is so my website can be easy to use. For my website I am going to aim for it to look simple and only show necessary information, I will also aim to keep the UI consistent, as well as preventing the user from making errors.
To verify this I will test the UI with my users to get feedback which will allow me to improve on my design.

### IMPLICATION NAME HERE

The functionality implications a website relates to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

Functionality is relevant to my website because it is important to have a functional website so that users will not have a hard time using it.

When designing my website i will consider how functional it is by making sure it does everything it needs to do and meets the purpose of the website. I will also need to ensure that there are no bugs in the website, it does not crash, and works as intended from the users point of view.
To verify this I will test the functionality of the website with myself or with my users, I will use the feedback to improve on the functionality.

### IMPLICATION NAME HERE

The aesthetic implications of a website will relate to how it good it looks in terms of the design.

Aesthetic is relevant to my website because it is important that it appeals to the users, and follows the design conventions
