# The Design of a Database-Linked Website for NCEA Level 2

Project Name: **Awesome Gymnastics Task Booking System**

Project Author: **Scott Noble**

Assessment Standards: **91892** and **91893**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

Gymnastics Nelson needs a list of tasks that parents and gymnasts can select and sign up for. They also need to track the people that sign up for a task.

### End-User Requirements

Replace this text with a description of your typical end-users and their specific needs / expectations / requirements.

### Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

The usability implications of a digital outcome relates to how easy it is for the end-user to use the website, without the need for help or guidance.

I will need to design my system to be as easy as possible to use because some of the parents of the gymnasts may not be as experienced in using technology as others. I will need to make sure my website can be used everyone no matter what experience they have.

When I am designing my websites UI I will refer to Nielson's heuristics, this is so my website can be easy to use. For my website I am going to aim for it to look simple and only show necessary information, I will also aim to keep the UI consistent, as well as preventing the user from making errors.
To verify this I will test the UI with my users to get feedback which will allow me to improve on my design.

### Functionality

The functionality implications a digital outcome relates to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

Functionality is relevant to my website because it is important to have a functional website so that users will not have a hard time using it.

When designing my website i will consider how functional it is by making sure it does everything it needs to do and meets the purpose of the website. I will also need to ensure that there are no bugs in the website, it does not crash, and works as intended from the users point of view.
To verify this I will test the functionality of the website with myself or with my users, I will use the feedback to improve on the functionality.

### Aesthetic

The aesthetic implications of a digital outcome will relate to how it good it looks in terms of the design.

Aesthetic is relevant to my website because it is important that it appeals to the users, and follows the design conventions

When designing my website I will consider how aesthetic it looks by creating an overall design that is suitable for the websites purpose as well as making it look good and ensuring that it appeal to the users. To do this I will choose certain colours and fonts that work well together so it pleases the users. I will position and group elements together in a way that is balanced and focuses the users attention. I will use feedback to improve my design.

### End-user

The end-user implications of a digital outcome are connected to the specific needs of the end-users.

End-user is relevant to my website because I need to know who my end-users are and if it works on all devices that my end-users are likely to use.

When designing my website I will need to ensure that I know as much as I can about my end-users. I will need to use language that is appropriate to my end-users age. I will design it in a way that will work on the devices that my end-users are likely to use. I will use feedback to improve my design.

### IMPLICATION NAME HERE

The social implications of a digital outcome involve how it affects users, the wider community and society as a whole.

Social is relevant to my website because I don't want to cause offence to anyone or stigmatise or stereotype particular social groups.

When designing my website I will avoid using racist or sexist language or images, as well as using gender neutral language where possible. I will also avoid promoting activities that have a negative impact on people / society (e.g. gambling, drinking, drugs, etc.)
