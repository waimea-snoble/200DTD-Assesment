### 20/05/2024

Creating first figma design

Today I drafted the first figma UI design so I could see how my website would look, and also get feedback from my client.

### 23/05/2024

I got feedback from my client and they said
>Instead of having the user input their surname and forename separately, it will be easier for them input at the same time. Add an option for the user to input their email because that is the way they will be contacted.

![Feedback for figma UI design](images/figma-feedback.png)  
I responded to this feedback by removing the surname option and just having full name option. I also made sure the end-user can input their email as this will be the main form of contacting the end-user.

Since my client wanted the end-user to input their full name and email, I needed to change the database design

Today I added an option for the admin to login, but I couldn't finish the delete task button. I also added the date next to the task. Accidentally clicked on the top task button, not meant to have blue outline.

### 27/05/2024

Today I am finishing the admin log in page.

![Alt text](images/figma-UI-designv3.png)
I finished the admin login page, finishing the delete task button and adding an add task button. I also made it so the admin can click on a task to see the people doing that task, as well as their contact information.

Today I have also changed the flowchart to show that the admin can view what people are doing the task.

### 30/05/2024

I got feedback from my client and they said
>When the admin is deleting a task instead of having the task confirmation on a new page, just have it on the same page. This is because it looks less confusing when it is kept on the same page.

![Alt text](images/figma-UI-designv4.png)

I responded to this feedback by doing what they said and making the it overlap the page.

### 11/06/2024

I got more feedback from my client and they said
>It would be useful if there was a way to split the tasks into categories so it is easier for the admin to see the tasks that people have signed up for and what category it falls under. This will help if there are any gaps to target helpers in specific areas.

My client also said
>I felt that the login at the top of the page might be confusing for volunteers signing up for the tasks, as they might feel that they have to login.

I listened to my client and moved the login button to the bottom of the page and changed the name to admin login. I also made sure there was a category list to make it easier for the end-user to book a task that they want to do. I also made it so when the admin is adding a task they can choose a category that the task will go into.
