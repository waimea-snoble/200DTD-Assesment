I got feedback from my client and they said
>Instead of having the user input their surname and forename separately, it will be easier for them input at the same time. Add an option for the user to input their email because that is the way they will be contacted.

I responded to this feedback by removing the surname option and just having full name option. I also made sure the end-user can input their email as this will be the main form of contacting the end-user.

Since my client wanted the end-user to input their full name and email, I needed to change the database design
